  Use before releases, when adding new dependencies, or as a periodic maintenance check — or when
  the user asks "are my dependencies up to date", "any known CVEs", "audit my deps", or "check for
  outdated packages". Produces a read-only report; no dependency changes are made. Complements
  ts-security-auditor, which handles code-level (not dependency-level) vulnerabilities.

# Audit Dependencies

This skill produces a **read-only npm dependency health report** — it makes no changes. To act on
findings, use `/ts-add-package` to add or update a package, or remove unused deps from `package.json`
manually and run `npm install`.

## Step 1 — Discover dependency manifest

Identify all dependency sources:
- `package.json` — direct `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `peerDependencies`, `optionalDependencies`.
- `package-lock.json` — resolved transitive graph (if present).
- Workspaces: if `package.json` declares `workspaces`, collect `package.json` from each workspace
  member and report per-workspace counts.

Summarize:
- Total direct runtime dependencies (name + version).
- Total direct dev/test dependencies.
- Total transitive dependency count (from lock file if available).
- Node.js version constraint from `"engines"`.

## Step 2 — Run available tooling

Run all available commands; skip gracefully if not installed:

```bash
# CVE / vulnerability scan (built into npm)
npm audit --omit=dev 2>&1
npm audit 2>&1

# Outdated versions
npm outdated 2>&1

# Unused dependencies (if depcheck is installed)
npx depcheck 2>&1 || echo "depcheck not installed"

# Unused / stale exports (if knip is installed)
npx knip 2>&1 || echo "knip not installed"

# License compliance (if license-checker is installed)
npx license-checker --summary 2>&1 || echo "license-checker not installed"
```

Include all output verbatim in the "Tooling" section.

## Step 3 — Manual review

For each direct runtime dependency not already flagged by tooling, check: version pinned in the
lock file (and is the lock file committed?); maintenance status (last release, open critical
issues, archived/deprecated on npm); transitive footprint (could a Node built-in replace it?);
types availability (bundled `.d.ts` or `@types/*` — missing types force `any` casts, flag as a
risk); ESM/CJS compatibility with the project's module system; and CVEs in the past 12 months.

## Step 4 — Report

```
## Dependency Audit Report

Manifest: package.json  <workspace member list if applicable>
Node.js version: <from engines or .nvmrc>
Direct runtime deps: <N>
Direct dev/test deps: <N>
Transitive deps: <N from lock file>  /  "lock file not present"
Lock file: <committed / missing>

### CVEs / Security vulnerabilities
<npm audit output, or "no vulnerabilities detected">

### Outdated packages
<npm outdated output, or "all up to date">

### Unused dependencies
<depcheck / knip output, or "tool not installed — manual review needed">

### License compliance
<license-checker summary, or "tool not installed — manual review needed">

### Manual findings

#### High
- `<package>@<version>` — <issue>. **Recommendation:** <action>.

#### Medium
- …

#### Low
- …

### Summary
<N> high issues requiring immediate action.
<N> medium issues recommended before next release.
<N> low / informational notes.
```

Omit tiers with no findings.
