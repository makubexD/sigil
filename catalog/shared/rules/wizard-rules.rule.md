title: Wizard Rules (Front End over CLI Flags)
description: >-
  Everyday rules for any change to an interactive setup wizard — every question maps to a flag,
  one code path with the commands, prompts only on a terminal and on stderr, review before any
  write, no partial state on cancel, and parity tests. The condensed, path-scoped form of the
  shared/wizard skill.

appliesToRationale: >-
  Scoped to source files for wizard engines, flows, prompt adapters, and the init/setup entry
  points, one glob per source extension (Copilot joins applyTo globs with commas, so brace sets
  can't be used). Extension-scoped so it doesn't load for the wizard skill's own markdown or the
  installed rule and agent files. Validators are not globbed: a generic validat* pattern would
  load these rules for every validation module in the project. Generic defaults: narrow them to
  the project's wizard files after install.

This project's setup wizard is a guided front end over its real commands. Apply these rules to any
change in the wizard, its entry point, or the commands and validators it uses.

- **Nothing wizard-only:** every question maps to one flag or positional of a real command. A new
  input gets its flag first. Flags given on the command line skip their questions.
- **One code path:** the wizard runs the commands' own functions (or the entry point), never a copy
  of their logic. Validators and choices are imported from the commands, never duplicated.
- **Terminal only:** prompt only when stdin and stderr are terminals and `--no-input` is absent.
  Otherwise never prompt or read answers from a pipe. Without `--no-input`, exit 2 and name the
  flags; with `--no-input`, run the same commands if every required value is given, else exit 2
  naming the missing ones. A destructive or remote command still needs its own `--yes`.
- **Streams:** prompts, hints, review and messages go to stderr; stdout carries only the commands'
  payload.
- **Every step:** a plain-words question, a hint, validation in the command's words, and cancel;
  back wherever the library allows it. The review always offers Back and Change an answer.
- **Review first:** nothing is written, deleted, or sent before a review that shows the summary and
  the equivalent one-line commands. Destructive or remote steps show a dry run (when the command has one) and default to no.
- **Exit codes:** 0 done, 1 declined or a command failed, 2 usage (including no terminal), 130
  cancelled (unless this project documents a different contract; then keep that one).
- **No partial state:** cancelling at any step or at the review leaves files and config
  unchanged; Ctrl-C while the commands run stops before the next one and exits 130.
- **Secrets:** a password prompt, handed over through the command's environment variable or stdin,
  never a flag, never shown in the equivalent command.
- **Structure:** navigation in a small engine; the prompt library behind one adapter file.
- **Tests:** a scripted prompter covers parity (answers → the same argv as flags), back, cancel,
  and validation; a spawned run covers the no-terminal exit and `--help`.

For design, audits, and refactors, use the `wizard` skill. The path globs that load this rule
are generic defaults; narrow them to this project's layout.
